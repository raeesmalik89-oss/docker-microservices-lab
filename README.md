# Docker Microservices Architecture

A professional microservices implementation demonstrating modern container-based development.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project showcases a complete microservices ecosystem built with Docker:

- **User Service** - User management and authentication
- **Product Service** - Product catalog and inventory management  
- **Order Service** - Order processing with service coordination
- **API Gateway** - Centralized API management and routing
- **Load Balancer** - Traffic distribution and scaling

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Deploy the entire stack
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor services
docker-compose ps
